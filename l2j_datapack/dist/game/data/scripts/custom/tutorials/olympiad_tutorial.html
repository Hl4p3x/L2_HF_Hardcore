Once you obtained noblesse status, you can fight for the title of hero!<br/>
Each town has an Olympiad Manager, the competition period is two weeks, each period, new heroes are chosen!<br/><br/>

The daily battles will start in the evening, you will have a system message notifying you that the competition has
started<br/>
You can register in class, none class and 3 on 3 battles, each queue has to have at least 11 people for matchmaking to
start!<br/>
Wining and losing affect your olympiad points, which determine the period winner and also the reward of olympiad tokens
that you will get at the end<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
