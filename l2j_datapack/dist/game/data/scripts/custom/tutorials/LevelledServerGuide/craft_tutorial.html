Everyone is a crafter, and will have their first crafting skill at level 20<br>
Try crafting basic equipment out of the items that drop from monsters<br>
First learn a recipe, it is an item that looks like a page<br>
Next, open you crafting window by using 'Dwarven Craft' skill<br>
Carefully look at the required items of your chosen recipe<br>
Drop the required materials from monsters or buy the resources you lack from players<br>
Once everything is set, just click 'Create'!<br><br>

Note, that every Weapon, Armor or Jewels you craft, can be randomly enchanted from +1 to +16<br>
Luckies crafters can even get their item double crafted<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
