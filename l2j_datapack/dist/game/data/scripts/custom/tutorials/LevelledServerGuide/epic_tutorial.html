Among the fiercest Raid Bosses, there are the ones called Grand Bosses!<br>
They drop unique jewelry and some even drop uncraftable equipment such as Vorpal and Elegia!<br><br>

Most Grand Bosses require a quest to be completed, before you can challenge them<br>
For example you need a special stone to access the teleport to Antharas!<br>
These bosses are the top of the monster chain, they require a large group of players to stand a chance against
them<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
