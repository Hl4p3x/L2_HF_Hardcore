Each town has a variety of shops<br/>
Most important one are Grocery, Blacksmith, Weapon and Armor shops<br/><br/>

In grocery you can buy 'Mana Drugs', 'Arrows', 'Soulshots', 'Blessed Spiritshots', 'Scrolls of Escape', etc<br/><br/>

In blacksmith you can get basic recipes and low level materials for crafting,<br/>
as well as sealing/unsealing B-S grade items, crafting D-S grade dualswords,<br/>
augmenting items, inserting and removing soul crystals from weapons<br/><br/>

Weapon and Armor shops provide you with the most basic equipment,<br/>
as well as a Equipment Upgrade option for low level items<br/>
If you are interested in high quality items, try visiting Luxury Shop in Giran Castle Town<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
