Subclasses are alternative classes for your main character<br>
At least one subclass is also needed to access the Noblesse quest line<br><br>

You can acquire subclasses after level 75 and second profession at any class master, without quests!<br>
Subclasses can be trained up to level 85<br>
Sub skills and transformations are removed from the game<br>
You can happily play your subclass as if it were your main, except for being able to participate in Olympiad<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
