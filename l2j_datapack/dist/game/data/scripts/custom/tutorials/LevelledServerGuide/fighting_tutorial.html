To effectively kill your opponents, you have to be buffed, and have you soulshots on<br>
Find your soulshots in the inventory and drag them to the action bar, once there, right mouse click them to enable
auto-activation<br>
Now that you are ready, double click your enemy to start an auto attack, and shoot your available skills from action
bar.<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
