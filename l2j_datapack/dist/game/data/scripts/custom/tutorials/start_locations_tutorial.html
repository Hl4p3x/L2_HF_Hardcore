There are separate starting locations for each race<br/>
Every starting location has hunting grounds around it that have mobs up to level 15<br/>
You can navigate these locations by teleporting around them with the help of a gatekeeper<br/>
Lady in white-green robes that is marked as a vortex on your town map (ALT+M)<br/>
To get back to the town or a nearest safe zone, you have to use a Scroll of Escape<br/><br/>

If you want to start with your friends or go straigth to a more populated starting zone,<br/>
use a 'Kamael Village Scroll of Escape' to get together in a matter of seconds<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
