Each town has a variety of shops<br>
Most important one are Grocery, Blacksmith, Weapon and Armor shops<br><br>

In grocery you can buy 'Mana Drugs', 'Arrows', 'Soulshots', 'Blessed Spiritshots', 'Scrolls of Escape', etc<br><br>

In blacksmith you can get basic recipes and low level materials for crafting<br>
As well as sealing/unsealing items, crafting dualswords<br>
Augmenting items, inserting and removing soul crystals from weapons<br><br>

Weapon and Armor shops provide you with the most basic equipment<br>
As well as a Equipment Upgrade option for low level items<br>
If you are interested in high quality items, try visiting Luxury Shop in Giran Castle Town<br>
Better equipment can be obtained by hunting monsters, bosses or crafting<br>
Top equipment is available only from Grand Boss hunting<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
