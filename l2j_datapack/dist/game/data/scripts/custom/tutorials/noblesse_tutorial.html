To become noblesse you should have a subclass of level 50<br/>
It will allow you to access the quest line 'Path Of A Noblesse Possessor Of A Precious Soul'<br/><br/>

Noble characters gain access to powerful buffs and can compete in the Grand Olympiad for great rewards and a chance to
become a powerful Hero<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
