Is this Skull Breaker for me? Thank you! You will be blessed!<br>
What? Money? I don't have any, silly!<br>
By the way, I need another favor! My son went to Talking Island seeking adventure! He'll be
graduating soon, and I want to send him this Skull Breaker as a graduation present.<br>
But there are some fearsome bandits laying in wait around here. You must kill them! <font
    color="LEVEL">Of course, I'll still need the Skull Breaker.</font><br>
