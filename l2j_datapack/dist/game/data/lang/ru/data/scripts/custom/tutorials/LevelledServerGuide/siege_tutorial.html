One of the most important upgrades for a clan to have, is a Fortress or even a Castle!<br>
Fortresses allow you to farm Epaulettes and gain great rewards in doing so.<br>
Castles give you status and ability to collect taxes, and setup manor!<br><br>

Both give you a daily upkeep resource bonus, which will increased 3 times per defense days<br>
For example, a Fortress will give you the best resource bonuses on the 3rd consecutive day that you own it<br>
Castles on the other hand, will increase reward 3 times but weekly, not daily<br>
Both Fortresses and Castles give you daily rewards, that are put into the clans warehouse<br><br>

To register a Siege, go find a Siege Manager near your desired target, and sign into the bloodshed!<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
