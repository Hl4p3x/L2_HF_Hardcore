To find an appropriate Hunting Location, you need to use the map<br/>
Open your map (ALT+M) and choose the Hunting Zone tab<br/>
Sort it by clicking the 'Level' column header two times<br/>
Now you can easily find a hunting ground best suited for your level<br/>
Most Hunting Grounds have teleports to them, from the nearest town<br/><br/>

If you are struggling to find a teleport to the town nearest to your chosen Hunting Zone<br/>
simply follow the chain of town portals Gludin-Gludio-Dion-Giran-Oren-Aden-Goddart-Rune<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
