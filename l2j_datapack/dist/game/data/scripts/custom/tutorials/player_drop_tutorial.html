Player Drop!<br/><br/>

Beware! Every time you die, you have a chance to drop something from your inventory!<br/>
It can be almost any item, even your armor, weapon and jewelry<br/>
There are different chances of item drop, by the cause of death<br/>
Death from monsters, clan wars, siege deaths, PK and PvP deaths are all treated differently<br/>
Augmented, epic jewelery and PvP items can be dropped as well!<br/>
Every time an item is dropped it has a chance to be broken into crystals!<br/><br/>

Best of drop to you!<br/>
