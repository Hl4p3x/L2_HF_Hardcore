Subclasses are alternative classes for your main character<br/>
At least one subclass is also needed to access the Noblesse quest line<br/><br/>

You can acquire subclasses by completing the quest line 'Fates Whisper' and 'Mimir's Elixir'<br/>
Subclasses can be trained up to level 85<br/>
Sub skills and transformations are removed from the game<br/>
You can happily play your subclass as if it were your main, except for being able to participate in Olympiad<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
