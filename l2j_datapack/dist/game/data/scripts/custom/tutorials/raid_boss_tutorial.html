Raid Bosses!<br/><br/>

To find a suitable raid boss, open your map (ALT+M)<br/>
and look for a boss that has a similar level to yours<br/>
Normally you will need a tank, a healer and a bunch of DD to kill a boss<br/>
So go on, create a party, shout in global chat to invite some players,<br/>
and kill that boss for all of the loot he has<br/><br/>

Raid Bosses have no level restrictions and are dynamically scaled as well<br/>
You can solo farm a 20 level boss with a 60+ level players<br/>
Low level players can help farming a 70+ level bosses with their 40 level characters!<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
