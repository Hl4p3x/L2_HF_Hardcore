Monsters and Player level have a dynamic scaling system<br>
It allows low level players to be useful even in a high level battle<br>
And prevents high level players to be one shot low level ones<br><br>

Keep in mind, even though low levels deal more damage to high levels and receive less<br>
Difference in gear and skills still gives the higher level player an advantage<br>
But it is possible to hunt down a 80 level player with a group of 52 level bandits<br><br>

Good luck!<br>
