Weapons and Jewels can be augmented with Life Stones to give additional properties and even skills!<br/>
A Life Stone shows the level of the character who can use it.<br/><br/>

Augment weapons through the Blacksmith NPC of every town.<br/>
Go to a blacksmith and click Augment Item.<br/>
Place all the items into the boxes as indicated.<br/>
Select the weapon to be augmented, the Life Stone, and Gemstones in the Augment window.<br/>
Click the Augment button.<br/><br/>

Warning! Augmentation does not prevent your item from being dropped upon death!<br/><br/>

Good luck!<br/>
