The clan that lives here has developed the ability to evolve their pets into special forms. Evolution is only possible when the pet is summoned. Also, since the process transfers the experience value, evolving a high level pet might actually result in a decrease in the pet's level.<br>
Any items in the pet's inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.<br>
Which pet do you want to evolve?<br><br>
